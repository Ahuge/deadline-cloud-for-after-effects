## How can I override the path to the AERender executable?

There is a feature within the AfterEffects Deadline Cloud package that allows you the ability to
set the `AFTEREFFECTS_ADAPTOR_AERENDER_EXE` environment variable and point to the after effects
aerender executable directly.

The recommended route is still to ensure that aerender is in your system path, however some clients
have found it easier to set an environment variable directly instead.
